IDESKCENTRIC may designate other files as Redistributables. You should refer to 
the documentation, including any "readme" or "deploy" files provided with the

terms and conditions of this License, you may freely redistribute source code 
or compiled code that is entirely your own and does not contain any
Redistributables. 

3.2 Certain Restrictions. Regardless of any modifications that you make and 
regardless of how you might compile, link, or package your Works: (a) you may
not permit your End Users to modify or further distribute Redistributables or

Work or other program that is generally competitive with or a substitute for
the Product and the IDESKCENTRIC MIB browser; and (d) you may only distribute

the Redistributables and are not merely a set or subset of any of the 
Redistributables, and that are created in accordance with the terms of this
License. 

3.3 Third Party Software. The Product, including Redistributables, may include
source code, redistributable files, and/or other files provided by a third
party vendor ("Third Party Product"). Since use of Third Party Product might be

for any license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor. In any event, 
any license restrictions imposed by a third party vendor are in addition to,

Redistributables, and such End User's sublicense rights to the Redistributables
are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this 
Section 4 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, 
including any component or Redistributable.

regulations issued thereunder. You agree to the foregoing and you are 
representing and warranting that you are not located in, under the control of,

of its component parts.

9. Confidentiality. The Product (including its underlying source code) and the
terms of this License contain confidential information of IDESKCENTRIC. You agree
to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person (other 
than your employees and individual contractors who use the Product and who have
agreed to keep confidential any of IDESKCENTRIC's confidential information that
you provide to them), and not use it for any purpose other than the use and 
operation of the Product as permitted under this License. These restrictions 
do not apply to any information which is or becomes (through no fault of yours)
publicly available. If you are required by law or order of a court or other 
government authority to disclose IDESKCENTRIC's confidential information, then
you will immediately notify IDESKCENTRIC as soon as possible, but in any event
prior to the disclosure, and will cooperate with IDESKCENTRIC, at its expense and 
request, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required 
disclosure. 

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL IDESKCENTRIC BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY
FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA,
ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, 
IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF IDESKCENTRIC KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IDESKCENTRIC'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU
